2021-01-03,b'@Aivabtc @google_me_now0 @SpacGuru @Spacul8r @SPACtrack $ALACR (rights) are currently trading between $0.75 to $0.80. Ten of them converts to one common share after the merger. What $5 and $13 rights are you looking at?'
2021-01-03,b'@google_me_now0 @SpacGuru @Spacul8r @SPACtrack @SpacCrack I bought rights to buy shares via $ALACR at 5$ why rights to buy at 13$ is cheap??? Makes no sense'
2020-12-31,b'$ALACR catching up .67 now. https://t.co/cJUJGrSA0S'
2020-12-29,b'$ALACR out remaining 5K at .60 from .4866 so +$567 and +22% and trade is closed. Totals = +$2101.00 on the buy/sell of 15K rights from .4866 to .64 to .60 sells. On a day like today I will gladly take ANY profits and get into cash. https://t.co/7hxGPcyhHA'
2020-12-29,b'Sold 10K $ALACR at $.64 from $.4866 +$1534.00 or +33%. Still holding 5K at .4866 avg https://t.co/2hIRwE6mIN'
2020-12-28,b'@ProAgSolutions I have 15K $ALACR at .49 I think. I sold all warrants'
2020-12-28,b'@mellowrk_lion Did you hang on to your $alacr ? I sold my warrants today In he 1.20\xe2\x80\x99s and trimmed some alacr nice run up'
2020-12-28,"b'$ALAC $ALACW $ALACR\nSo people bullish on this solar energy play. They are buying warrants that gives rights to buy de-SPAC at 14$ now with chance its worthless if no merger. With rights, you buy rights to buy de-SPAC at 5$, same risk. Why do people waste money? #SPACs'"
