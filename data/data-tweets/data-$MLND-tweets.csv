2021-01-01,b'@RoccoLefkowitz $MLND perfect i will. u should follow @danwardbio as well good guy knows whats up. $OBLN very risky half position there only because of potential 3.00-5.00 on merger but running on fumes.'
2021-01-01,"b""@willtopol If I were you I wouldn't listen to me. Your picks are living up to your name even if they break all my rules. I'm the one trying to learn how this is done. I will check out $OBLN. If you like strategic alternatives check out $MLND, been waiting for that one to hit for 7 months."""
