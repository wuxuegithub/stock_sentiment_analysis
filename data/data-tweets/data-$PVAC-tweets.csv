2021-01-03,"b'@John70856972 John, firstly thank you for your support. BTW Excellent money management! $pvac has been on my watchlist for a while. Current chart does not look great. Price has fallen below 10.6 and could not overcome on Retest. Looks like a test of 50DMA coming to me at 9.32.'"
2021-01-03,"b'@thegoodprick What happened to $PVAC? Sold most of mine at high $11s, but didn\xe2\x80\x99t expect it to come down to $10.  Still like it? Any chance it slow grinds up like $CLF? Thanks.  Love your charting.'"
