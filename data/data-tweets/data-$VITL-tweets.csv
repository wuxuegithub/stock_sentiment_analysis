2021-01-02,"b""@curvenomics What's interesting about $VITL is revenue growth trajectory looks like a SAAS stock but profits are there, too. Just expensive on earnings basis.\n\nThey don't seem to own much infrastructure, they mostly do sourcing and marketing, so it's all about the revenue stream / brand."""
2021-01-02,b'@calvinfroedge $CALM. I have liked this company for some time.  Their dividend policy is smart. I will look at $VITL'
2021-01-02,"b'$VITL is kind of interesting. Basically hippie food brand selling eggs sourced from small farm network. Kind of expensive but they do make money and earnings growing rapidly.\n\nHuge growth despite low penetration, huge TAM.\n\nStill very pricey even after 30% decline since IPO. https://t.co/gE7e35Ng8z'"
