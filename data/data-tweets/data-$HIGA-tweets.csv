2021-01-01,b'@ajitosu @Doc_Steve_Brule for $HIGA - I have 500 - looking to go up 1000 shares if price keep falling'
2021-01-01,"b'@IamANM @Doc_Steve_Brule One thing which I learnt very quickly is I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a long term investor temperament. That being said, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any fav. Most of the warrants which I like are expensive though, some still under $1.6 are $HIGA $CPSR $HZAC $GOAC $ETAC $AVAN $VACQ $PIAI $IMPX $MAAC'"
