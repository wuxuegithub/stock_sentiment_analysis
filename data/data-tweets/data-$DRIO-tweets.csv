2021-01-03,b'@BenRabizadeh @jablamsky @StoryTrading My feeling also. I started buying $LVGO in January last year &amp; had a very nice ride with it. Lost a little bit of my enthusiasm in the merger but believe $TDOC to be a fantastic comp. But think $DRIO could be a fun growth play this year.'
2021-01-03,b'@AnetteRombout @jablamsky @StoryTrading $TDOC is a 10 year hold. It\xe2\x80\x99s never too late. $DRIO though I expect will eclipse TDOC performance this year by many fold.'
2021-01-03,b'@BenRabizadeh @jablamsky @StoryTrading I have been following $DRIO for a while and believe they are doing good. Thanks for the info @BenRabizadeh \xf0\x9f\x91\x8d\nI stepped out of $TDOC on the $AMZN news and regret it. Want back in to the sector and am pondering on where it\xe2\x80\x99s best to enter.'

2021-01-03,b'@richard_chu97 Richard - I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why $DRIO cannot go on a 500-1000% run this year if they convert just 20-25% of their pipeline as they have been guiding. It\xe2\x80\x99s interesting to me why you don\xe2\x80\x99t have more DRIO relative to $TDOC. Seems like it has more potential this year.'
2021-01-03,b'@Soumyazen $DRIO is my favorite! Easy 5-10x return if they simply execute what they\xe2\x80\x99ve telegraphed.'
2021-01-03,b'@jordanelist @mandrilman @richard_chu97 That\xe2\x80\x99s an easy 5-10x return in $DRIO stock from current levels.'
2021-01-03,b'@jordanelist @mandrilman @richard_chu97 $DRIO has past an inflection point in its business model and is now onboarding multiple payers and employers in a business model similar to $LVGO. Not only is their multiple half that of its peers but their revenue will ramp up 3-5x current levels in the next 12-18 months.'
