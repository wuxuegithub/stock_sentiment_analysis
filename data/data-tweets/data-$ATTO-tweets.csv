2021-01-02,"b'@islandvalue It should be a good year for $ATTO although Covid was a surprise in 2020 so we\xe2\x80\x99ll see what surprises 2021 holds.\n\nAs for $MDP.V, the minimum size is $1000 of face value so about $1170 now. They have a minimum maturity of $125 so with the coupon of 6%, have a YTM of 7.3%.'"
2021-01-02,"b'@BrownMarubozu thanks, some of your tweets on $ATTO helped to get me started on the name!\n\ndo you think the converts are more attractive wrt to the downside protection? are these minimum 100k lot sizes?'"
2021-01-02,"b'@islandvalue We have some overlap! $ATTO is my second biggest position.\n\nI also own the $MDP.DB. If you are a Canadian resident, you may want to consider the bonds instead of $MDP.V. It\xe2\x80\x99s much more attractive than the common, in my view.'"
