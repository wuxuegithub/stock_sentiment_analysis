2021-01-07,b'$IEA pre market looking good. $AMCI should run with clean energy looking strong &amp; potential sympathy off $PLUG which got some really good news.\n\nWill mainly be watching today and doing some DD on the next runners. In the mean time hopefully you are banking big on $MARA $PERI $IEA'

2021-01-06,"b'Overall, I think very sound decision making on the swings through the first three days of this week. I think I could have detected the reversals in $FUBO and $QS earlier. Also, I think I  didn\xe2\x80\x99t need to make the $PERI trade I did today, but I was smart to exit at breakeven.'"
2021-01-06,b'$IEA added some more on the dip earlier after the craziness in DC. Why it\xe2\x80\x99s always sensible to keep some funds in your account to add dips. Still holding cash in case there\xe2\x80\x99s more red tomorrow.\n\nStill holding $MARA $IPOF $ETAC $AMCI $PERI $THBR'
