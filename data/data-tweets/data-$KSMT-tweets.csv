2020-12-29,"b""@SpacGuru Okay, so to my question. What's your feel on $KSMT?\n\nAs far as the warrants being cheap, that's based on the general pricing for warrants of SPACs with a capitalization of $300M +. \n\nAs far as whether the warrants will go to zero at some point, that's a matter for a later date."""
2020-12-29,"b""@SpacGuru What's your feel on this one? $KSMT has a current market cap of $322M, No news, no nothing that I can find.\nThe warrants are dirt cheap @ $1.30 for a SPAC of this size.\n\nDo you have any info or a feel on this one?"""
