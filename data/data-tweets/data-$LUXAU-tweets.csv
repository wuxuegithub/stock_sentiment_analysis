2020-12-29,"b'@Post_Market @alexkagin I hear you, but in my experience a lot of these can be acquired at ~5% premium for some window of time ($INAQ was still trading in $11s post-announcement of their deal and involvement of Chamath and Cuban) and $LUXAU was in the $10s for a while'"
2020-12-29,"b""@Post_Market @alexkagin don't disagree, but why not plow more capital into SPACs with known success rate / reputable promoters? e.g. $INAQ, $LUXAU, $RPT etc? unless your allocation to SPACs is large enough to have capacity to keep doing lots of these"""
