2021-01-03,b'Write-up about $MWK \xf0\x9f\x91\x87\xf0\x9f\x8f\xbb https://t.co/DyZXADdidb'
2021-01-03,"b""-- E-commerce is a multi-trillion dollar market that will only continue to grow. Against this backdrop, several factors could propel $MWK's growth, including new products, international expansion, and licensing of its technology. It will be curious to see how far $MWK can go."""
2021-01-03,b'-- $MWK has demonstrated financial growth across the board. Revenue has grown at a 50% CAGR since 2017 and $MWK neared break-even in its most recent quarter.\n\n-- It has also consistently increased the number of products with $500K+ in annual sales (e.g. 37 in 2019 to 67 in 2020). https://t.co/8MEcfOV3n2'
2021-01-03,"b'-- $MWK has also been able to grow its product offerings through asset acquisitions. It has purchased successful e-commerce businesses with complementary product offerings at attractive multiples. Using AIMEE, $MWK optimizes the market positioning of the newly acquire products. https://t.co/lhr5DOerX8'"
2021-01-03,"b""-- Durable quality products are the focus because $MWK aims to build product moats via positive reviews. When consumers search for a product to meet a need, the goal is for $MWK's product to appear high in the returns with positive reviews that work as social proof. https://t.co/9iWCse3eiS"""
2021-01-03,"b""-- $MWK intentionally focuses on durable home essentials and consumer electronics. Eschewing trends and fast fashions, its focus is on products that will have a multi-year use and demand.\n\n-- For 2021, $MWK's goal is to launch 10 products per month with a focus on quality."""
2021-01-03,"b'-- $MWK currently offers ~280 products across 11 brands, 5 of which it launched and 6 of which it acquired.\n\n-- Its product lines largely consist of durable consumer goods, such as ice machines, knife sets, standing desks, and hair straighteners. https://t.co/zcQCIk20Hm'"
2021-01-03,"b'-- For example, at $50 it may take $10 in marketing expenses to sell a product. By lowering the price to $40, it may take only $2 in marketing expenses. $MWK makes these changes in real time in response to market dynamics.'"
2021-01-03,"b'-- Control over the sale of a product is another key $MWK edge. Because $MWK sells its product directly, it can control pricing, descriptions, and images in real time. This control enables optimization.'"
2021-01-03,"b""-- Once $MWK identifies an opportunity, it has the supply chain in place to bring a product to market in 6-8 months.\n\n-- The product is then marketed and sold on e-commerce platforms like Amazon and Walmart, using real time data to optimize the product's position."""
2021-01-03,"b'-- Whereas traditional CPG companies have generally used outdated methods to identify consumer trends, $MWK relies on data.\n\n-- Its AIMEE platform ingests enormous amounts of data on a daily basis, analyzing search data and websites for data points on developing consumer trends.'"
2021-01-03,"b'Spotlight: Mohawk Group Holdings \n\n-- Founded in 2014, $MWK is a technology-enabled consumer products company. It uses its proprietary AI Mohawk eCommerce Engine (AIMEE) to identify product opportunities and bring products to market to satisfy unmet consumer demand. https://t.co/zOOtHFQT30'"
