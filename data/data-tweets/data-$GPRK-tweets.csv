2021-01-01,"b""@Token70429267 @RaisingTheBAR47 Yes I used the estimates from $PXT's earlier deck  - had lower prices. I have a bad feeling about OPEC production coming back + vaccine delays etc, so might as well. \n\nStill think $GPRK has better r/r, but depends on how you feel about their indico reserves and ONGC videsh."""
