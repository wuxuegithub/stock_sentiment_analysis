This is why both went big into virtual LTO: $RCII bought Preferred Lease/Acima and $AAN bought $PGR. AAN smart to spin off PGR, likely endgame for RCII as well. vLTO more comparable to BNPL but secured vs unsecured lending'"

2021-01-04,"b'@TidefallCapital Would also suggest taking a look at $PRG (recent spin off from $AAN) and $RCII (which just announced combining their Preferred Dyanmix with Acima), today the #1 and #2 in the LTO space both with $2B+ revenue (10x Katapult today).  Better valuation as well...\n\nh/t @icebergdevalor https://t.co/uIm8wscwiI'"

2021-01-03,"b""@StocksWarlock It's an interesting story in an emerging new fintech mkt; virtual lease to own (VLTO) which is very similar to BNPL (Afterpay, Affirm) except that they deal with with people who have weak credit (which is said to be 40% of US consumers.) $RCII is another way to play VLTO - fyi."""
