2021-01-02,b'@raptorak why dont you have a bag of $FLC then.... it only makes sense... they are the creators of $DEXG 40k mc rn'
2021-01-02,b'Hey @jollen \n\nI added a coin request for @realFlowchain \n\nhttps://t.co/Vd267qJbW0\n\nSpread this to others in the $FLC &amp; $DEXG community so the coin price could be tracked in the @get_delta app.\n\nDo the same for @blockfolio'
2021-01-02,b'Currently looking deeper into $FLC sitting at around 40k market cap. Their other token $DEXG is at 10 mil mc. @realFlowchain could at least make a run pass 1 mil. github seems legit.\n\n#Lowcap #Microcap #Gems #Uniswap #Degen #Altcoin #Bitcoin #Etheruem #IOT #Blockchain #Flowchain https://t.co/u7ujKErKCF'

2021-01-08,"b'$FLC Hard to believe the market cap halved in 2020. Their cash position increased +260% to A$70m, they closed out the Ivory Coast project (US$190m), had nil dilution and streamlined non-core business units. Surely some love for the shareholders soon?\xf0\x9f\x99\x8c\n\nhttps://t.co/SZnlCdwcCp https://t.co/qyctanZLQs'"
