2021-01-08,"b'@EyeoftheStormZ $GOGO, $SLGG, $WYNN etc disagree! Also, I think you are far to generous and caring to have a broken spirit. What you did for @ChildrensPhila is not the act of a broken man. You are inspirational, motivational, and educational. At least to me at any rate! https://t.co/yO0uEUuSSJ'"

2021-01-07,"b""Continuing to swing $AESE for now. It's an online gaming stock like $SLGG, but it's acting better. Looking for it to show me it'll form a curl back up here. https://t.co/pAiABlZ3RH"""
2021-01-07,"b""Exiting $SLGG swing with 10% losses. Not waiting for the 50ma test. I'll continue to monitor and maybe 50ma will allow for better entry. https://t.co/n9dYi4y7SO"""
2021-01-07,b'@caucasus_invest @HarryGodfrey17 Yes and to use a term that is popular these days $SLGG seems to be experiencing exponential growth. \xf0\x9f\x98\x89. Therefore 10-15 M in revenue does not seem ridiculous by end of this year.'
2021-01-07,b'$SLGG  I bought the dip on this one.  Sold some other losers so got cash to add. https://t.co/jrATzDlk00'
