2021-01-08,"b""$NVFY looks like some bears showed up.   Go ahead and short, like you did with $NTZ.   I'm going to sleep on this as we now consolidate at higher levels.   It didn't break the HOD before lunch so not banking on it now, but longer term price targets are where I am aiming for."""
2021-01-08,"b'$NVFY book value $11, trading at $3.20.  $NTZ book value $9.36, called it at $0.56, now trading at $13.    You know where this is going.   Flip for pennies, and you lose out.'"
2021-01-08,"b'Glad I got shares recently at $2.48 thanks to @Stefanoalfano13 and his discord.  Now here is the kicker.  $NVFY is not only low float, but literally $NTZ 2.0, and the blockchain is another added value.  Book value is $11/share. You also have the MONTHLY breakout happening. https://t.co/DPJfehjHTt'"
