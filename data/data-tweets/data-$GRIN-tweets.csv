2021-01-07,b'@scooter_d613 @8bitpath Well until miners pay their bills with $GRIN it is the fiat value of the block reward that matters. If price keeps trending down network will become less secure even with same block reward. #Bitcoin hashrate (and security) continues to rise after halving due to price increase.'

2021-01-06,"b'@capital_opps @8bitpath $GRIN only has ""high"" inflation in the beginning, like all crypto coins. The flat emission rate is actually anti infationary, and better for long term network security because the block reward doesn\'t diminish.'"

2021-01-06,b'@8bitpath Agree completely with MW being amazing technolony. Our issue is with the team and their decisions since launch. With the high inflation it is clear $GRIN is meant to be used! Adoption must be the primary focus or it will remain a niche coin for purists with little market value.'
