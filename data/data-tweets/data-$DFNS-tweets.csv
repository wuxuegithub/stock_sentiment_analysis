2020-12-30,"b""$DFNS $DFNSW\n\nWarrants are up 7% so far today. They are over 50% the way to needing to make a decision without having to do an extension. I'm expecting an announcement in the next 3 months. Warrants under &lt; $1.75 are just way too cheap. \n\n#Stocks #StockstoWatch #Investing #SPACS"""
