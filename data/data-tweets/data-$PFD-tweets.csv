2021-01-05,"b'Wow, looks nice, I hope ASDA is not charging an arm and leg to the suppliers $PFD for this? The jury is out whether this is better money spent compared to TV/Billboard advertisement. But I would rather see this running in a category where there is competition eg. Sauces vs Pataks https://t.co/tcDByUWInX'"
2021-01-04,"b'""annual sales of approximately $114 million and is expected to grow at a mid-to high-single-digit rate"" Wow thought that was a tad too rich. Just goes to show $PFD\'s current valuation is paltry. https://t.co/CRsNtIw0gn'"

2020-12-31,"b""Aldi revenue in UK last year was around \xc2\xa313bn, let's hope the \xc2\xa33.5bn over 5 years is not just proportional increase of existing listings but new listings with suppliers like $PFD. ALDI has been the slowest growing throughout the pandemic when consumers have shifted to $PFD brands https://t.co/KNCytCS8Xh"""
2020-12-29,b'Been 2 SBRY so far and lots of Pataks products made in Poland out of stock. Contrary to credit ratings agencies about geographic diversification in the age of Pandemics and Brexit $PFD is a safer bet than $ABF supply chain. https://t.co/biBt1hunOj'
2020-12-28,"b'Brits have spent more money on rice, noodles and pasta than they\xe2\x80\x99ve spent on fresh potatoes, thanks partly to $PFD innovation https://t.co/yGKnZ3GeNQ'"
