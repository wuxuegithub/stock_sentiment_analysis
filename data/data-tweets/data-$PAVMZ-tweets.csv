2020-12-31,b'@BrickCityCEO $PAVM at $2.10 should mean $PAVMZ at about $1.27. It is much lower than that'
2020-12-31,b'light day for me..added a decent chunk of $XL and accumulated a little more $PAVM and $PAVMZ. \n\nhappy NEw Year! Be safe'
2020-12-31,"b'@DrNiUnaDietaMas If $PAVM is at $2.11, $PAVMZ should not be at $1.13. Liquidity is a concern but buying warrants is cheaper still.'"
2020-12-29,"b""I did end up adding to my $PAVM and $PAVMZ positions today. The PAVM chart just printed a double bottom on the daily...cherry on top to the bull-thesis. I've noticed technicals are playing out at a higher rate in the current market conditions."""
2020-12-29,"b""@TheWineRecipe Agreed. We'll see how mkt reacts to what I think will be a bunch of little PRs rolling out in the coming month or four (about insurance contracts, official pricing, sales, etc.) Interesting that $PAVMZ premium is higher now than it was during last year's rally."""
2020-12-29,b'@Pharmdca Some bozos are selling $PAVMZ at $1.14-$1.17; 8%-10% discount'
2020-12-29,b'I like the upside of the $PAVMZ warrants a lot too'
2020-12-29,"b""I bought a little starter in $PAVM last week, along with a few $PAVMZ warrants. Now they're both up 20% and I want more...kind of hope it dips today but I don't think it will"""

2020-12-28,"b'@TheMarkCooke We have names in common, so some fell hard. Techs are ~1/3 of my book. ~1/3 is Biotechs but even my star $OCUL acted like $FSLY or $NET today. $EOSE and Biotechs $ONCT and $PAVMZ did better. China is ~1/3. That subgroup was up ~6%.  So a green day overall.'"

2020-12-28,b'@phillyrealty @ripster47 $PAVMZ is still trading cheaper than it should; probably because of liquidity. Do you have the latest numbers on shares and warrants after all these offerings?'

2020-12-28,b'I also have a bet with myself of $PAVM closing over $2.00 on 12/31.  No one took the under lol.   $PAVMZ CC @DJ_Dan79'
