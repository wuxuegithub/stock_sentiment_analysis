2020-12-29,"b'@ripster47 might I add here $LOACR as spec play...especially for ""smaller accounts"" \xf0\x9f\x98\x9c. $LOACW are 2:1, i.e., u need 2 warrants for right to buy 1 share @ $11.50. $LOACR are 10:1, but u don\'t pay $11.50/share, u just get the shares. + less liquidity: $LOACR squeezed to $4 when $LOAC hit $19'"

2021-01-06,"b'@ripster47 FYI these warrants are 2:1 conversion instead of normal 1:1 conversion, hence the seemingly low price on warrants as they have less upside potential. I.e., Buying $ESSCW @ $1 is equivalent to buying most other SPAC warrants @ $2. Same reason I prefer $LOACR over $LOACW @Pharmdca'"
