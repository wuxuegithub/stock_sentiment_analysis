2021-01-02,b'@valuedelay Don\xe2\x80\x99t think it would preclude anybody. You don\xe2\x80\x99t want the people that just buy the IPO for the warrants anyway as they\xe2\x80\x99re not in for the long game.\n\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a few SPACs with no warrants already. $ARYA and $RACA are some examples.'
