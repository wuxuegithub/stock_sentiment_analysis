2021-01-04,"b""@hamids @chamath Yes. Many other good cheap ones out there, too: $NSH, $CLII, $DCRB, $SPRQ.U, $SVSV.U, $IMPX\n\nFrom post-LOI ones, $STPK (Target: @stempowered) is my favorite by far and a core holding, based on Tony Seba's predictions. @chammath said he prefers AI as a moat in batteries too."""
2020-12-31,b'@PatrickBaitman3 That is what I did with $SPRQ.U units.  Will get a common and a 1/2 warrant for right now $10.70.   (I paid 10.49 avg) No target yet but I\xe2\x80\x99ll take a run with Apollo again....Worst case (highly improbable)it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t run at all after target named - I sell for $10 and keep warrants'

2020-12-30,b'Added additional funds to trading account today.  Doubled my $GIK warrant holdings ($GIK.WS) and added additional units of $SPRQ.U (good for 1 common &amp; half a warrant when shares released). https://t.co/eTr47Tnaju'
2020-12-28,"b'$SPRQ.U More in my wheelhouse, units in this (from those that brought us $FSR) are trading cheap vs. other recent sustainability names such as $DCRB and $ACTC (which I both like and own as well). A full share and half a warrant for less than $10.80 is relatively attractive.'"
2021-01-08,"b'@SpacVet $DCRB is another one, not quite as cheap as $SV and $SPRQ.U, perhaps not quite as sexy as $ACTC. Maybe it is the porridge that is just right? https://t.co/LjNqKkAVXW'"
