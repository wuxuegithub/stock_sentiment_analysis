2020-12-30,"b""-- In short, to support its current valuation, $APPF needs to continue to grow its profitability, but may struggle to do so given that spending remains high and competition is only getting more intense. \n\n-- It's unclear what moat protects $APPF market share and profitability."""
2020-12-30,"b'-- International property markets are seen as a promising area of growth for $APPF, but that expansion comes with its own set of costs, including increased sales expenses, designing products for specific markets, and managing regulations and taxes, among other challenges.'"
2020-12-30,"b""-- Not only is the larger market more competitive, but competitors have also increasingly entered the SMB market. The competition includes IBM, Accruent, Buildium, and Yardi.\n\n-- Yardi, for example, offers platforms that compete directly with $APPF's but at a lower price point."""
2020-12-30,"b'-- As these opportunities started to dry up, $APPF began to target larger property managers - a more competitive market. \n\n-- To compete, it invested and continues to invest in more dynamic offerings, such as Property Manager Plus launched in 2018.'"
2020-12-30,"b'-- One explanation for the decelerating revenue and increasing expenses may be that $APPF has picked all of the low hanging fruit.\n\n-- After gaining traction early on, $APPF\'s product likely ""sold itself"" to small and medium size property managers excited for ease and efficiency.'"
2020-12-30,"b""-- $APPF's revenue growth has decreased the last four quarters from 33.75% YoY in Dec. 2019 to 23% YoY in Sept. 2020.\n\n-- $APPF's spending on sales and marketing and R&amp;D has also increased and remained high over the past four quarters, eating into operating margins."""
2020-12-30,"b'-- The ability to live up to its current valuation is the #1 concern for $APPF.\n\n-- Based on current estimates, $APPF trades at 298x P/E ratio on 2020E earnings.\n\n-- $APPF could struggle to support this lofty valuation due to slowing growth in an increasingly competitive market.'"
