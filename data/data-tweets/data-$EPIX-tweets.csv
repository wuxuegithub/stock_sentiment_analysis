2020-12-30,b'@encodelp @BayAreaBiotechI @gcbioinv PK for ARV110 looked rough too at least at the time of 140 mg data. Expectations were way too high for $ARVN - not at efficacious dose but seems their getting there. Think $EPIX is in strong position with 200 mg starting dose. In efficacious range and should get to 400 mg quick'
2020-12-30,"b'@BayAreaBiotechI @gcbioinv $ARVN valuation has always had the ""platform"" premium.  mCRPC/110 was only part of the story, as evidenced by recent spike after data in breast/471. $EPIX single-asset, pure-play mCRPC, so success in Ph1 is critical. Agree 7386 has combo &amp; potentially safety advantages over 110'"
2020-12-30,"b'@BayAreaBiotechI @gcbioinv Curious what market expectations are for PSA50 in Ph1 for EPI-7386. In May $ARVN Ph1/2 w ARV110 (140mg+) had ~20% mCRPC patients achieve PSA50 &amp; stock nosedived. Safety was also an issue for ARV110, but suspect 7386 needs to beat these PSA50 to get market buy-in $EPIX'"
2020-12-30,b'@gcbioinv @BayAreaBiotechI Is luck AND skill an option?!\n\nAgree w/ the good Dr. That plus Pfizer/Myovant deal helps. Recall $PFE led last $EPIX financing.
