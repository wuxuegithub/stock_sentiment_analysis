2021-01-06,"b'@ripster47 FYI these warrants are 2:1 conversion instead of normal 1:1 conversion, hence the seemingly low price on warrants as they have less upside potential. I.e., Buying $ESSCW @ $1 is equivalent to buying most other SPAC warrants @ $2. Same reason I prefer $LOACR over $LOACW @Pharmdca'"
2021-01-06,b'@peony_king Next week $loac should be over $20. $loacw will be around $10. Stupid flippers selling'
