2021-01-04,"b'@LuisVSanchez777 @TidefallCapital @icebergdevalor 2) Agree legacy branch based LTO secularly challenged. This is why both went big into virtual LTO: $RCII bought Preferred Lease/Acima and $AAN bought $PGR. AAN smart to spin off PGR, likely endgame for RCII as well. vLTO more comparable to BNPL but secured vs unsecured lending'"
2021-01-04,"b'@TidefallCapital Would also suggest taking a look at $PRG (recent spin off from $AAN) and $RCII (which just announced combining their Preferred Dyanmix with Acima), today the #1 and #2 in the LTO space both with $2B+ revenue (10x Katapult today).  Better valuation as well...\n\nh/t @icebergdevalor https://t.co/uIm8wscwiI'"
