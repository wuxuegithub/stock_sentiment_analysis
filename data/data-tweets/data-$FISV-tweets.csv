2021-01-02,"b'40) Let\xe2\x80\x99s recap: Lots of moving pieces across the 3 subsegments of $FISV Payments &amp; Network, but $3B+ of identified incremental revenue opportunities on a current base of &lt; $6B would appear more than sufficient runway to support the 5-8% growth outlook for the combined unit \xf0\x9f\xa4\x97 https://t.co/BNrwYaA7ra'"
2021-01-02,"b'39) For this Digital Payments subsegment, $FISV is guiding to a 5-7% growth outlook, implying $100-120M/year of incremental revenue on a current base of ~$1.8B, which does not feel heroic given the tailwind of $1B+ of identified revenue opportunities from just 3 initiatives https://t.co/V6lysa0KNu'"
2021-01-02,"b'38) With CheckFree Next, $FISV has incumbency you drive adoption: ~4,000 Bill Pay clients today including 24 of top 25 banks, 29M active Bill Pay users, network of 8,500 billers, access to ~60% of all eBills in US\n\nFISV sizes this as a $350M+ incremental revenue opportunity https://t.co/SVhIfZK0DQ'"
2021-01-02,"b'37) There are a number of pain points $FISV $MA $ACIW will solve with their respective next gen Bill Pay offerings: streamlined biller onboarding, smarter connectivity to billers, real-time payments leveraging new RTP rails, all from a consumer\xe2\x80\x99s mobile banking app/wallet https://t.co/O4QVD9zkmB'"
2021-01-02,"b'36) $FISV is dominant in bank Bill Pay (1.5+ of 2B bills paid in \xf0\x9f\x87\xba\xf0\x9f\x87\xb8) and among the leaders in a fragmented market enabling Bill Pay directly with billers, with $ACIW $MA notable as well given their assets and aspirations in this space: up for grabs is $4-5T volume TAM in \xf0\x9f\x87\xba\xf0\x9f\x87\xb8 alone'"
2021-01-02,"b'34) With the advent of real-time payments (RTP) in the \xf0\x9f\x87\xba\xf0\x9f\x87\xb8, $FISV has enhanced TransferNow to enable instant fund transfers and mobile app/online banking integrations with banks/fintechs to drive growth +15-20% annually\n\nFISV sizes this as a $150M incremental revenue opportunity https://t.co/pt4a46Spf5'"
2021-01-02,"b'33) Already a large player enabling ACH, $FISV launched the TransferNow A2A interbank fund transfer platform, now an industry standard used by 7 of top 10 US banks to securely move $150B+/yr between the DDA and other internal or external accounts (e.g. MMA, brokerage, etc.) https://t.co/JbIPxcT8dE'"

2021-01-02,"b'31) To date ~1,000 banks have signed up to use the Zelle network, but only ~730 are live today\n\nOf this, 550 (75%) were onboarded by $FISV, the undisputed leader in Zelle enablement with hundreds more in the pipeline (including 2,000 on legacy PopMoney to eventually convert over) https://t.co/0PHkinyw2u'"
2021-01-02,"b'30) Zelle is owned by EWS (itself owned by 7 large US banks) and only the big banks with sizable IT budgets have managed direct integration for P2P on the Zelle network\n\nThe long tail of 10,000+ small banks/credit unions are reliant on processors like $FISV to enable use of Zelle https://t.co/M7Ichus69u'"
2021-01-02,"b'29) All $FISV digital payments offerings now sit on the NOW Network, 3 near term opportunities are:\n\n- Zelle P2P enablement\n\n- TransferNow real-time A2A funds transfer\n\n- CheckFree next generation bill pay\n\nTogether these represent an incremental $1B of annual revenue potential https://t.co/i41T1uz89A'"

2021-01-02,"b'27) These market leading capabilities were developed/acquired over the past 12+ yrs, most notable are $FISV acquisition of CheckFree (in 2007 to gain market leading position in bank Bill Pay) and launch of NOW Network (in 2014 to consolidate and accelerate efforts in P2P and A2A) https://t.co/c2G514mDau'"

2020-12-31,"b'4) These $FISV card payments businesses are 2/3 of segment revenue, roughly equally split between:\n\nIssuer Solutions: processing for large issuers\n\nCard Services: processing for small/mid-sized issuers + the PIN debit networks\n\nLots of synergies across these complementary assets https://t.co/TqP7HAyFcy'"
