2021-01-07,"b""@Natenatedogdog @modestproposal1 For sure, tho the expectations implied by today's stock price are much steeper compared to where $EB traded this summer"""

I think $EB can *potentially* be a high margin/secular growth story beyond the recovery. But mgmt needs to execute, esp as it relates to its frequent creators!'"
2021-01-07,"b""@modestproposal1 This is rly helpful point. I look at a trade I made like $EB and it's easy to feel vindicated even though any recovery name would have likely yielded a similar result."""
