2021-01-04,"b'11 / $SPI lots of marketing is coming down the pipe and it\xe2\x80\x99ll get attention and the demand WILL come. You have been warned, this is my last time talking about https://t.co/QpMboNg7wJ \xf0\x9f\x9a\x80\xf0\x9f\xa4\x9c\xf0\x9f\x94\xa5 #GoodLuck'"

2021-01-04,b'8 / The best part is the 10% entry exit fee for stakers. It keeps everyone honest and dedicated to hodling. Great community plus long term + huge rewards driver. $SPI'
2021-01-04,b'7 / The people who got in early are already staking their tokens. 30% tvl already. Currently earning 2.5-4% daily. $SPI'
2021-01-04,b'6 / I expect each big global consumer promotion cycle will trigger free publicity for $SPI. I expect only more ans more people will want to spend their crypto on Amazon. Both memberships offer massive lifetime savings.'
2021-01-04,"b'5 / Since only about 20% of the available 1000 STARTER or 500 PRO memberships remain available for purchase on the open market, price will balloon over time as people discover the opportunity. $SPI'"
2021-01-04,b'4 / There is a private VIP community and learning area for all STARTER and PRO members. The founder Arbel and team will churn out new dropshippers like clockwork over the next few years... $SPI'

2021-01-04,"b'2 / ... and these https://t.co/QpMboNg7wJ memberships are scarce since only 1m tokens will ever exist. Read between lines, demand for memberships increases token price. $SPI'"
2021-01-04,b'1 / https://t.co/QpMboNg7wJ STARTER and PRO include membership perks available to people who hold at least 1000 or 2000 $SPI tokens. Cost of memberships is currently 1150$-2500 if you factor in current token price'
