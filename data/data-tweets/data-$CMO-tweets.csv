2021-01-04,b'@ShagwongS I had to buy more $CMO at the close today. Low $5.60s is too cheap. That is a 20+% discount to BV.... insanely cheap for that GSE mREIT.'
2021-01-04,b'i think $TWO and $CMO probably best buys out  there being pure GSE  plays and fat discounts to BV and $NRZ in general given it will do something to create a market price for its #NewRez lender sub ( probably in Q1 ) . In CRE i like $RMRM with a new portfolio of loans made post'
