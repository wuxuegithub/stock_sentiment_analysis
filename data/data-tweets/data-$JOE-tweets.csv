2021-01-08,b'@weeklystockchar Had to come to NW Florida to lay eyes on what $JOE has going on &amp; seeing the demand for properties made me pull trigger. Kuppy has this as his #1 play fwiw as well. Might need to consolidate a bit before next leg. Love the story. Have to see it firsthand to appreciate the thesis.'
2021-01-08,"b""@stockspotify $JOE's a good 1 in the $ITB/$XHB space. I know it's a had a good run lately. On TV, chart is a little choppy - that's a BATS data thing.  So, I prefer names w/ a little more volume like $TOL, $LEN, $DHI, etc. &amp; some of the housing related names that are also in the $ITB/$XHB."""
