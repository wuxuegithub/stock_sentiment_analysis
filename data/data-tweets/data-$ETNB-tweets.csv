2021-01-04,"b""@lblegend33 @semodough Don't believe so, tho time will tell. Own $MDGL &amp; $ETNB. Maestro-NAFLD now @ 1200 pts (vs 900 plan) &amp; on time - highlights demand. Multiple BP trials (NOVO,PFE,GILD) and many NASH names at $500M+ mkt cap. Not indicative of dead space - perhaps 2022 is yr, starting with $MDGL"""
